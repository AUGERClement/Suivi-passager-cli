# SuiviPassagerCLI

This project is a response to the following technical [test](https://github.com/Coderative/suivi-passager/).

This small CLI tool is a MVP.

It prompt the user for a number of entering and exiting passengers in a stop, then log the current statut in a file.

## Run with cargo

Use cargo run to use start the tool

## Docker

Due to the inability to interface Terminal from container to outside terminal, the Docker for the project was given up. May be updated if Docker bring up a solution for this use case
