# SuiviPassagerCLI

This project is a response to the following technical [test](https://github.com/Coderative/suivi-passager/).

This small CLI tool is a MVP.

It prompt the user for a number of entering and exiting passengers in a stop, then log the current statut in a file.

## Docker

Just pull the compose, edit the stop list and roll out.
You can either copy the final log in a txt yourself, get the one generated in the container, or setup a shared volume to have Docker printing in your machine.
